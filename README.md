Hide cursor in sculpt mode

  When called from search it can hide cursor in Sculpt mode when mouse over View3d and bring it back over other areas.

## bugs

  If mouse get back to view3d cursor still appears - have no time to get it done.

## todo

  Checkbox could be appended to VIEW3D_PT_tools_brush_display_custom_icon.draw().
